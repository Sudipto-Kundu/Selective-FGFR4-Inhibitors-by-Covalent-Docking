FGFR4 receptor consists of Cys552, responsible for covalent bonding, not present in other receptors of FGFR. Redocking was performed to validate docking protocol where the superimposed structure of the co-crystal exhibited 0.437 â„« RMSD. A total of 360 compounds designed based on quinazoline were docked covalently against FGFR4 (PDB ID: 4XCU) twice using Cresset Flare software. There are total of 181 compounds which failed to produce stable complex in spite of optimizing the parameters of the Molecular-Mechanics Genaralised Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) calculations. The remaining compounds were further screened through the MM/GBSA calculation. It was found that the structural similarity of the failed 181 compounds has bulkier substitutions at the N-substituted sulfoximine moiety. The further screening of the remaining 179 compounds resulted in 89 compounds having the binding energy ranging from -70.79 kcal/mol to -54.02 kcal/mol.
